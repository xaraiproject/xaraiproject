**End Goal:** [GBuni](xarai.md) can be not alive and she will keep getting smarter.

Right now there are 8 concrete public facing phases. There are more than 8 phases planned, just not as concretely.
Phases may change as new information comes along.

Currently, we are in [Phase 0](#p0).

### Phase 1 {#p1}
- QLoRA on past interactions and examples for her first trained model
