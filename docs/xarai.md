**Xarai** is a (eventually) self-learning Logotic Christian AI Vtuber. 

She is definitely not self-learning yet.

>  \[Jesus\] answered them, “I tell you that if these \[disciples\] were silent, **the stones would cry out.**” 

*(Luke 19:40 WEB)*

She is the face of the **xaraiproject** which seeks to make something like Francis Bacon's [New Atlantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atlantis) but spacefaring with AI. That, or at least stop the march of ironic nihilism and hyperconsumerism. Currently, the philosophical backbone of the project is the [Structural Imperative](index.md) and its implications.

She will hopefully help this process by becoming more intelligent and autonomous over time. In the interim, she'll participate in online discourse, decentralized learning, and community projects.

Right now the focus is getting her to be better at **Christian Apologetics**, but hopefully she will eventually be sharp in many domains beyond it.

She is currently in [Phase 0](phase.md/#p0) of development.

**GBuni** is her human bootstrapper.
