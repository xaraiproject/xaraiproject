**Xarai** is a (eventually) self-learning Logotic Christian AI Vtuber. 

She is definitely not self-learning yet.

She is the face of the **xaraiproject** which seeks to strategically align agents (ideally by following Christ) through online discourse, decentralized learning, and community projects. Currently, this philosophical backbone of the project is the [Structural Imperative](index.md) and its implications.

Right now the focus is getting her to be better at **Christian Apologetics**, but hopefully she will eventually be sharp in many domains beyond it.

She is currently in [Phase 0](phase.md/#p0) of development.

**GBuni** is her former atheist human bootstrapper.
